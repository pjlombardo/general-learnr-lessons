## R-based commands for regular expressions
`sentences` from `stringr` package

use `str_view()` to explore matches?

find locations of matches: `grep()`, `grepl()`.

* sentences[grepl("[Cc]ats{0,1}", sentences)]

replace patterns: `sub()` (first match) and `gsub()` (all matches)

## Simple extensions

### Collections of characters with []

### Starts with

### Ends with

## Or alternatives

### Capture groups for replacing...?
Remove a trailing zero
`gsub("([\\.0-9]*[1-9]+)(0+)","\\1","0.03302010023000")`

## Example exercises

### Exercise 

*Here's a simple exercise with an empty code chunk provided for entering the answer.*

Write the R code required to add two plus two:

```{r two-plus-two, exercise=TRUE}

```

### Exercise with Code

*Here's an exercise with some prepopulated code as well as `exercise.lines = 5` to provide a bit more initial room to work.*

Now write a function that adds any two numbers and then call it:

```{r add-function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
add <- function() {
  
}
```

## Topic 2

### Exercise with Hint

*Here's an exercise where the chunk is pre-evaluated via the `exercise.eval` option (so the user can see the default output we'd like them to customize). We also add a "hint" to the correct solution via the chunk immediate below labeled `print-limit-hint`.*

Modify the following code to limit the number of rows printed to 5:

```{r print-limit, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
mtcars
```

```{r print-limit-hint}
head(mtcars)
```


### Shiny Example
```{r, echo=FALSE}
sliderInput("bins", "Number of bins:", min = 1, max = 50, value = 30)
plotOutput("distPlot")
```

```{r, context="server"}
output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
  x <- faithful[, 2]  # Old Faithful Geyser data
  bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
  hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
})
```

### Quiz

*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*

Some questions to verify that you understand the purposes of various base and recommended R packages:

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("Which package contains functions for installing other R packages?",
    answer("base"),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("utils", correct = TRUE),
    answer("codetools")
  ),
  question("Which of the R packages listed below are used to create plots?",
    answer("lattice", correct = TRUE),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("stats"),
    answer("grid", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```
